Welcome to the Blog! Where I share things too long to be included in a typical documentation or a social media post.

I'm Thomas Nguyen, a Mechanical Engineer by day, amateur Software Engineer by night, but always a Raspberry Pi fan.

It all started in the Summer of 2020, right when COVID hit. I was living in a friend's living room with a laptop and a mattress.
I spent my last 100$ on a Raspberry Pi and an electronic kit. Fast forward a few years later, that has helped me get some internships and eventually a full-time job as a Mechanical Engineer. 

That 100$ kept me entertained and fed through the worst of time. 

I have used Raspberry Pi on so many projects: from remote control cars to cyberdecks to complex industrial communication systems. 

***As a man of optimization, I found a flaw in the development process***

The opensource nature of the Raspberry Pi community is a beautiful thing, but there's little to no standards on how projects are built and shared. That leads to long development and debugging time as well as un-usability of open source projects (due to lack of documentation, unsuported libraries, etc.). 

**For 3 years, I have been waiting for a solution by somebody, anybody.... and found nothing**

***So I decided to do it myself***

Since 03/2023, I have been working on the Comfy Project - a minimal Raspberry Pi framework, meant to save you time. It includes:

**ComfyScript**, a list of pre-written python scripts that can be used to control Raspberry Pi components.
For example, controlling a Stepper Motor would take 30+ lines of Python and 10+ minutes. But comfyScript lets you do that in 1 line of code in less than 1 minute.
Similar improvement is found with other components.

***This is highly scalable.***

**ComfySpace**, a customizable control interface on your phone and PC. Imagine creating a remote control robot, you would need buttons, joysticks, PCB, batteries to assemble a controller. Afterwards, you need to pick a communication protocol, program it yourself, etc. That costs money and time. **ComfySpace** replaces all that with your phone touchscreen + SSH communication protocol.

**Create a button, tell it what to do when you swipe, touch, etc.** Done!

The time saving here is phenomenal!

This allows you to get to a functional prototype quickly, and **focus on the making**. The frustration from things not working can take the joy out of the process.
ComfySpace allows user to use any python or bash command, but I recommend ComfyScript. As ComfyScript is always stored on the Raspberry Pi host, you can edit it to get more power as you please.

This brainchild of mine has taken me 9 months to develop and I will continue to work on it as long as it benefits the community.

Thank you for reading!

**Keep on making cool stuff**
