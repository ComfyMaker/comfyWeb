# What's a space?

A space is a clickable card on your screen. It stores SSH and login credential information about your Raspberry Pi.

**Put in picture with all information with arrows**

Simply put, you can click on it to start controlling your Raspberry Pi remotely.

# Create a space

Shout "Mom, I need some space!" and you'll get some

Just kidding.

First, press the + button on your screen
Next, enter your Raspberry Pi information and press "Done"

Congrats! You have created a Comfy Space.

# Use a Space

Click on it. Seriously, it's that simple!

When first clicked on, your Space will go through a setup process.
It's all automatic, and Ducky will guide you through what's happening.

It all happens between 3-5 seconds. So if you want to see more of Ducky, you can find him in the Setting and Suggestion page on the home screen.

***Don't touch a thing while Ducky is still on***

Once everything is setup, the message and Ducky should disappear. 

You will see a collapsible terminal (we haven't had any fancy name for it *yet*). This will print out important messages/logs. If that's not important to you, collapse it.

Anyway, let's learn about some buttons (the actual useful stuff) in the next part!
