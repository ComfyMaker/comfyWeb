# Add some buttons
Once you're inside a Space and the Space has fully loaded (Ducky has disappeared), let's add some buttons!
<img src={CreateButton} width="180" style={{float : 'left', paddingRight : '20px'}}></img>
Press the + button, and you will be presented with some options

There are two types of buttons:

1. Component specific buttons
These are meant to control specific components with pre-determined gestures.

2. Custom/Gesture buttons
You can assign specific commands for pre-programmed gestures. You can use your own Python or Bash commands. 
We also have **ComfyScript** for faster iteration speed.
