# Get started with Raspberry Pi (for beginners)

Raspberry Pi is a single-board computer. Just like a computer, Raspberry Pi can do computing tasks like your phone and computers. But more impressively, Raspberry Pi also allows users to connect components for many projects related to Robotics, AI computation, Smart Home, etc.


# Recommended Operating System
Techinically, ComfySpace works with any and all Operating System with SSH connection built-in on any computing devices. But we do recommend [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/) & Raspberry Pi OS.
