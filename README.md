An application to create customizable interface for Raspberry Pi projects


# The Mission

Raspberry Pi and IoT devices are powerful, open, and well supported by a community of greatly enthusiatic makers & engineers. But I have always found it tedious and hard to create a control/input interface. 

Of course there are buttons, but they are made mostly for demo, not a final product. There are a few apps available, but most of them are made for specific projects with buggy UI or have limitted built-in functionality. 

ComfySpace is made to change that - a more customizable solution.

You can make an interface the way you want with the device you already have: the phone in your pocket and laptop/PC you have at home.

Are you a maker? ComfySpace allows you to create an interface of choice and share online.

Are you the designer of a special sensor, component or HAT? You can create a sharable interface for your user to test and use such components?

Are you a company making products out of the Raspberry Pi ecosystem? ComfySpace is what you need to easily make a demo project into an attractive engineering solution.
