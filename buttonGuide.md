# What is a button?
Inside each space, you can add buttons to control & monitor Raspberry Pi and its components. You can use a button to toggle LEDs or read data from a distance sensor

# Create a button
To create a button, you can choose the type and enter respective credentials

There are two types of buttons: pre-built and custom.

Pre-built buttons are already designed with certain functionalities in mind (LED on & off, motor to run clockwise-stop-counterclockwise, etc.). You just need to enter the corresponding pins connected and the system will refer to ComfyScript to control & read from such components. 

Custom buttons are well... more customizable. There are certain actions built-in (toggle, slider, etc.) and you can assign commands of your choice to the buttons' functionalities. 

# Functionality in progress
- Draggability: The ability to drag and re-organize button positions
- Color assignment: Each button will have its own color
