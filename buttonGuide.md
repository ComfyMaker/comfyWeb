On app bar, you can see the space name.
Right below, you will see a 3-dot widget and a black screen. That is the [comfyScript]() widget and a terminal. 
The comfyScript widget searches for and update the comfyScript folder in your Raspberry Pi. After the update is finished, the comfyScript widget will disappear and report completion to the terminal. <br>
***This is not something to concern about, if curious: learn more about [comfyScript]()***<br>

A terminal is a screen to tell you what's happening: a button is pressed, data is accessed, comfyScript is updated, etc. This is useful for bebugging.<br>
