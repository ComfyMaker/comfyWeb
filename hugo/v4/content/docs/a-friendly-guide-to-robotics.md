## The Veins - Creating Connections

To connect all the above components, you'll need wires.

Although there are various types of wires, jumper cables are the best option due to their ease of use and the fact that they require no soldering.

These cables come with two types of ends: male and female. The male wires connect to female connectors on the components and vice versa. It's that simple!

Every robot requires a power source, which can either be a battery or a power supply.

For stationary projects or those with a small proximity, a power supply is the go-to choice. However, for projects that need portability, a battery is essential.
