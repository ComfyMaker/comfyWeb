## The Senses - Sensing Surroundings

Some robots also possess the capability to sense their surroundings: they can hear sounds, see objects, measure distances, and even recognize objects with simple AI functionalities.

These features can be used to gather information for security cameras, object detection, object monitoring, etc., or to drive autonomous actions like sounding an alarm if an intruder is detected, or making the robot move when it sees you.

To achieve these sensory functions, your robot might require one or more (or none at all) of these components, again depending on your desired application:

- Light sensor
- Camera
- Microphone
- Distance sensor
- Human presence sensor (yes, it's a thing and it's cool)
- and much more: if you think of a sensor, it probably exists

The world of sensors is truly fascinating. As science evolves, it offers creatives a plethora of options to experiment with.

## The Veins - Creating Connections

To connect all the above components, you'll need wires.

Although there are various types of wires, jumper cables are the best option due to their ease of use and the fact that they require no soldering.

These cables come with two types of ends: male and female. The male wires connect to female connectors on the components and vice versa. It's that simple!

## The Juice - Powering Your Creations

Every robot requires a power source, which can either be a battery or a power supply.

For stationary projects or those with a small proximity, a power supply is the go-to choice. However, for projects that need portability, a battery is essential.

## Parting Words

Hello, folks! This is Thomas the Maker, your friendly assistant. I hope this guide has been helpful to you. Robotics can seem like a complex field, but I aim to simplify that. I believe this beginner-friendly guide has given you a clearer understanding of the basic anatomy of a robot, helping you visualize your ideas better.

If you have any questions or ideas to share, don't hesitate to let me know!

Thank you for reading, and remember to keep your creative juices flowing!
