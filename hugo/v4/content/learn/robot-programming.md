title: How are robots programmed?
description: Robots are programmed using various languages and specialized software. Let's dig in! üëÄ

img_note: There's going to be lots of Michael Reeves' references...

    - description: This is Michael. He has this amazing idea of a robot üí°
      img: "/learn/robot-programming/idea.png"
      img_note: Just your typical totally-ethical idea
    - description: So he assembled a bunch of components needed for the build. There's a Raspberry Pi, a few sensors & motors.

      img_note: A collection of Raspberry Pi, distance sensor & stepper motors.

    
    - name: What is programming for?
      description: At this point, to make the components come together & perform a useful functionality, we need to do some programming!
    - description: The codes will help the components communicate with each other, performing useful functions. This turns a collection of plastic & metals into a real robot! ü§ñ

    - name: Python - everyone's favorite
      description: One of the most popular programming language. It's simple to learn & easy to write. Most major hardware has support for this language - 9Ô∏è‚É£ / üîü.

      img_note: A simple "hello world" program running on Raspberry Pi OS
    
    - name: C & C++ - the grandfather of programming languages
      description: As some of the oldest programming languages, C & C++ have been adapted into the world of robotics. It's a lower level language, meaning harder to learn & use. On highly sostiphicated robotics programs, C & C++ can provide greater performance compared to Python. However, for most projects, the difference is negligible. 7Ô∏è‚É£ / üîü.

    - name: Honorable mentions
      description: Other programming languages like Javascript & Go are traditionally used for software development like apps, websites, etc. However, they have been adapted to robotics development recently. Personally, I believe there's little benefit unless you have existing understanding of the languages. 5Ô∏è‚É£ / üîü

    - name: ComfyScript - a language built for robotics
      description: Python and C are industry-standard and amazing, but as general-purpose languages, they need some programming know-how to get started. 
      note: They're not specifically optimized for robotics development.
      
    
    - description: This often means writing 20+ lines of code just to build simple robots with 1-2 components. The complexity can deter people from exploring robotics and makes collaboration tricky since the code can be hard to read.

      img_note: Don't let this long program scare you, we have a solution!
    - description: That's why we are creating ComfyScript, a scripting language made for programming robots!
      note: Programming robots as simply as speaking English üó£Ô∏è

    - description: ComfyScript is a language dedicated to make it crazy simple for beginners to program their robots. Every component in a robot (LED, motors, sensors, camera, etc.) can be controlled with 1 line of code.
