# Day 0: First Raspberry Pi(s)
It was summer of 2020, right when Covid hit. Living in a friend's living room with a computer and a mattress, I spent my last 100$ on a Raspberry Pi & an electronic kit. 
Fast forward 3 years later, I have worked many jobs and done many Raspberry Pi projects. But there's a problem: The Raspberry Pi development path is very messy, ***especially with control interface***.
You need a logic, a communication protocol, extra components, and time - lots of time. And it's always finicky. 
I went looking for a solution to get from idea -> demo -> finished product that is minimal and user-friendly. I found nothing.

# March 2023: ComfySSH
I began development of [comfySSH](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tech.comfystudio.comfyssh&hl=en_US), a minimal SSH client. Even got a cool post on [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tungvunguyen_as-if-working-as-an-mep-engineer-in-the-day-activity-7053871011187826689-Q4h5?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop). 
It's scrappy, but it was my introduction to mobile development (and eventually cross-platform development).

# June 2023: Comfy Space began
After publishing ComfySSH to the Play Store, I realized: This is not what I wanted. And so Comfy Space is born, from the rubble of ComfySSH.

3 months and 200+ github commits later, Comfy Space is launching!
