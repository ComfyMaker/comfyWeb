# What is Comfy Space ?

***Comfy Space*** is an application to build buttons that control and read data from Raspberry Pi and associated components like sensors, motors, HAT, etc.

I hope to bring a more user **friendly** & **fast** way to get your project moving. Meanwhile, power users are provided with good documentation to get even **finer control** in their projects.
