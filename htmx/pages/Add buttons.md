# Add some buttons
Once you're inside a Space and the Space has fully loaded (Ducky has disappeared), let's add some buttons!
<section style={{clear:'both'}}>
<img src={CreateButton} width="180" style={{float : 'left', paddingRight : '20px'}}></img>

Press the + button, pick a button, enter button information.

There are two types of buttons:
- Component buttons:
These are meant to control specific components with pre-determined gestures.

***[Introduction to Component buttons](/docs/Component%20specific%20buttons)***

- Custom buttons
You can assign specific commands for pre-programmed gestures. You can use your own Python or Bash commands.

We also have **ComfyScript** for faster iteration speed.
