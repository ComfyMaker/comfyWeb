# Custom buttons

These are buttons with built-in gestures (tap, swipe, etc.) and you can bind that with a command (Python, bash or [comfyScript](https://github.com/ThomasVunguyen/comfyScript)).

You're not bound to the specific components and can execute multiple commands at once.

This is great for more custom/complex projects!
***Think of all the cool things you could make with this***

Imagine a swipe controlling multiple motors and executing other commands!
