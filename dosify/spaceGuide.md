# What is a space?

A ***space*** is a collection of buttons to control and read information from a single Raspberry Pi. It looks like below.<br>

In this example, Mars Rover is your ***space name***, nasa is your ***username***, and raspberrypi.local is your ***hostname*** 

***Note: you can also use IP is hostname such as 192.168.0.1***
