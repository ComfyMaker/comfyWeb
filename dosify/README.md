Starting making more <ins>***comfortably***</ins> with Raspberry Pi

# What is Comfy Space ?

***ComfySpace*** is an application to build buttons that control and read data from Raspberry Pi and associated components like sensors, motors, HAT, etc.

I hope to bring a more user **friendly** & **fast** way to get your project moving. Meanwhile, power users are provided with good documentation to get even **finer control** in their projects.
# The Mission

Raspberry Pi and IoT devices are powerful and well supported by a community of greatly enthusiatic makers & engineers. But I have always found it tedious and hard to create a control/input interface. Typically, you would need to create your own logic and UI, which takes lots of time to test and is not very reuable.

Just tell the app how the components are connected & what control you need, ComfySpace will take care of the rest.

Are you a maker? <br> ComfySpace allows you to create an interface for your robots, home servers, LED matrix, etc. 

Are you a company making products out of the Raspberry Pi ecosystem? <br>
ComfySpace lets you create widgets & applications to control your products. Think of how you can use Wix to create a website instead of hiring a web developer for your website - a lot less hassle.

Are you a software and/or Raspberry Pi enthusiast?<br>
